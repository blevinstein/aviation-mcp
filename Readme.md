## Future Integrations

### Insurance Integration
- SkyWatch.ai API integration planned for insurance services

### Flight Planning
- 1800WXBrief.com integration planned for flight plan filing and activation

### Optional Integrations
- OpenSky Network API for ADS-B data (not required for core functionality)

## User Information Requirements

The platform requires the following user-provided information:

### Pilot Information
- Ratings and certifications
- Currency status
- Personal minimums
- Goals and preferences

### Flight Information
- Origin/destination
- Aircraft details
- Maintenance status
- Equipment status
- Flight rules (VFR/IFR)
- Time of flight
- Payload/passenger information
- Mission goals

## Important Notes

### Aircraft Performance Data
- Third-party sources will be used for aircraft performance data
- All data should be verified against official POH/AFM
- Prominent warnings will be displayed regarding data verification
- Data includes:
  - Fuel planning parameters
  - Weight & Balance calculations
  - Service envelope
  - Takeoff & landing distances
  - IFR/FIKI capability
  - Oxygen system requirements
  - Required equipment lists
