# Information submitted by the user

- pilot information (ratings, currency, minimums, goals)

- flight information (origin/destination, aircraft, maintenance/equipment, flight rules, time, payload/passengers/programming, goals)

# Other sources needed

airplane limitations performance etc (needed for fuel planning, W&B, service envelope, takeoff & landing dist, capable of IFR/FIKI, availability of supplemental oxygen, required equipment, etc etc)

- this will likely come from a third-party unofficial source, so the POH takes precedence, lots of warnings to this effect should be displayed

- this one is expensive and buggy:

https://aviationstack.com/documentation#aircraft_types

- this one doesn't have detailed info but it's a good start:

# Future data sources

- Integrate with
