# Flight Planning

## Gather information

Before briefing a flight, you will need to know:

### Pilot Information

- Ratings and certifications
- Currency (for IFR, to carry passengers)
- Personal weather minimums
- Goals and preferences 

### Flight Information

- Origin and destination airports
- Aircraft details (what kind of airplane we are flying, details about W&B, performance, etc - get info from POH)
- Maintenance status (has the plane received required inspections and maintenance?)
- Equipment status (specific equipment/avionics on this aircraft? do we have all required equipment?)
- Flight rules for the flight (VFR/IFR)
- Time of flight (when are we trying to depart)
- Payload/passenger information (how many people, weight of people and baggage, etc)
- Mission goals (e.g. are we trying to get hours, trying to reach a destination, trying to have a smooth sightseeing flight, etc)

## Consult Data Sources

Next, you will augment the information above with information from official data sources:

- Weather (check METAR/TAF/CWA/MIS/PIREP/windtemp/fcstdisc tools)
- Check for airports along the route and near your origin and destination. For origin/destination and nearby airports, get the runway lengths, elevation, and frequencies in use.
- Check for features/obstacles/navaids/fixes along the route, for purposes of avoidance and navigation.

## Summary and Briefing

- You may brief the pilot on the likely conditions they will encounter on this flight as planned. Not especially concerns related to the weather, the capability of the aircraft, etc.
- If the pilot has not chosen a route, you may suggest navaids/fixes/features to navigate by. However, note that you do not have an airspace data source, so they will need to check what airspaces are along this route.

## Direct the Pilot to Additional Sources

These sources are best viewed in a browser:

- NOTAMs (link to https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/nsapp.html for now, the tool is not working)
- Check for TFRs along the route (link to https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=map)
- ATC delays (link to https://nasstatus.faa.gov/)
- You can also direct the pilot to the graphical weather map, but you should first brief them on the situation based on the weather/forecast data available, and suggest what weather conditions they should be most concerned about, if any: https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/
- More detailed aircraft information, including approach charts, available here for most airports (replace KXYZ): https://nfdc.faa.gov/nfdcApps/services/ajv5/airportDisplay.jsp?airportId=KXYZ

For their EFB, the pilot may want to download the relevant charts. You can get links to sectional/TAC/enroute charts, TPP, and chart supplements using the appropriate tools.
